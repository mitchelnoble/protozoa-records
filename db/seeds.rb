As Thundercat, Bruner takes his Jazz roots and works with a mix of artists that suit his wildly experimental sensibilities. Thundercat teamed up with executive producer Flying Lotus once again, to form a profound body of work for his second album, Apocalypse, the album straddles lines and pushes genres further, blurring the confines of Pop, Funk, Electronica and Prog Rock, and creating something else entirely. Both vulnerable and fearless, a comedy and tragedy, Apocalypse is an intimate portrait of an artist who will continue to take music to a new place; the beyond.",

    price:24.99,
    description:"Beat Tape 2 follows a string of well-received releases since it's predecessor Beat Tape 1, including his Out To Sea E.P with Carmody, a white label release on hip-hop label Soulection, collaborations with the likes of Bearcubs and reworks of Mos Def and Busta Rhymes. On Beat Tape 2, Tom has evolved his sound from it's origins in Boom Bap hip-hop stylings of producers like J Dilla to encompass his diverse range of influences. Tom's music finds the sweet spot between electronica, hip-hop and acoustic, predominantly linked by a single quality: soul. 'Its about the feeling you get from the music that makes it soulful, and for me that comes down to the chords. If it's a nice, soulful chord progression that's what makes it soulful and gives you that warm feeling. A lot of Gospel music, J Dilla, Erykah Badu and Jazz - I find that very soulful. That's what I listen to, so I guess that comes out in my music.'",

    description:"Discovery is the second studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk, released on 26 February 2001 by Virgin Records. It marks a shift from the Chicago house sound prevalent on their first studio record, Homework (1997), to a house style more heavily inspired by disco, post-disco, garage house, and R&B. Comparing their stylistic approach to their previous album, band member Thomas Bangalter described Discovery as an exploration of song structures and musical forms whereas Homework was "raw" electronic music. He also described Discovery as a reflection of the duo's childhood memories, when they listened to music with a more playful and innocent viewpoint.",

Sir Elton John summed it up best saying, 'Gallant is gonna be huge.'",
